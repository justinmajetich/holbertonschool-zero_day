The "0x02-vi" directory houses files associated with the Holberton project of the same name. This project offers the student a brief overview of the VI(M) text editor and its commands. Each of these files contains a VI(M) command which performs the action suggested in that file's name. For example, "2-pasting" contains the command for pasting buffer content into current line in the VI(M) editor.
